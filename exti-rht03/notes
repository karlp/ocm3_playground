on stm32 with 5v io.
solid 54-56uSec intervals for the "pre-bit" timings. (but stretches to 68 after a one bit?)
solid 28usec for 0 bits
solid 70-72~usec for 1 bits.
solid 80usec low/high pair before bits.
pullup to 3v for 22usec, then spike to 5v from pullup when we switch to float in.
before almost instant pull down into the 80usec pre...
seems perfectly suitable for us to count the falling edges...
first falling is possibly when we are first pulled down for the ack
if so, first falling is at very close to t0
second falling then at ~160usec, third (first real bit) at 50usec+(28/60usec)
if we don't catch the pull down,
first falling is at ~ยน60usec, then second (first real bit) at 50usec+(28/60)

entire transfer is ~4ms from when we first pullup and release to when it idles high afterwards.

so, once you're going, ~80usec is a 0, ~120usec is a 1.
