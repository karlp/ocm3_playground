Reading RHT03 Temperature & Humidity Sensor with STM32 VL Discovery board.

Status: working complete!

This code works out of the box on an STM32VL Discovery board, with the RHT IO pin
connected to PB9.  You need to use the 5V output to power the RHT03, as the
Discovery Board's "3v3" output has a diode on it, and is only 3V, which is not
enough for the RHT03 (Trust me, I've tried, repeatedly)

The code uses a basic timer to count uSeconds, and EXTI as an ugly/cheap/flexible
input capture module.  This means you can connect the RHT03 to basically any IO
pin you like, rather than only something connected to an Input Capture on a timer.

The code is interrupt driven, so while it is waiting for bits to arrive, it
uses ARM's "WFI" instruction to go to sleep.  Current consumption measured on
the Idd pins of the Discovery board indicate ~3.5mA current consumption.
(was ~10.5 when using busy waiting)

A console is output on PA2 @ 115200/8n1, displaying the count of seconds since boot,
and the temperature and humidity as measured.
